# Build System
NodeBuldier.js is a system that makes it easy to make different releases of the product. An example use case is Aioewa that will be available on different browsers. This means that the setup has to be different.

You can use it like this:
```
npm builder chrome-v3
```
Witch will give a build of the product as a chrome extension and placed at the default path.

## Setup NodeBuldier.js

```json
{
	"name": "Aioewa",
	
}
```
