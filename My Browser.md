# My Browser
MyBrowser is a chromium or firefox based browser that is yours. It lets you do anything with it. This means that customizability is one of the highest priorities.

Some settings I thought of:

 - Move anything anywhere. This means that everything is their own component and can be placed anywhere on the window. Options like anchor will be needed for this, so that you can anchor a component to something. If you move this something the component will move with it. It will too hide if the something hide. (Makes it possible for popups and etc.
 - Extensions
 - Ability to make your own user-scripts and user-styles. These are NOT limited to webpages. You can make your own components that run these when clicked, holde, double-clicked and etc.
 - APIs. You can make your won APIs. These can be used in your js or css for the places you want them to be accessible.
 - Shortcuts
 - You can change already made components and stuff. You can too use them as template for newer things. Example a user profile popup, for your user. You can copy and paste this and make your own little user options. 
 - The only thing that ALWAYS be accessible is edit. Edit is the thing that lets you change script/components, delete and make new ones. This will be default on `right click > edit button in option`, but you can set it to be anywhere (like a shortcut). Just remember to have it somewhere.
