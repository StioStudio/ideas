# My Browser
MyBrowser is a chromium or firefox based browser that is yours. It lets you do anything with it. This means that customizability is one of the highest priorities.

Some settings I thought of:

 - Move anything anywhere. This means that everything is their own component and can be placed anywhere on the window. Options like anchor will be needed for this, so that you can anchor a component to something. If you move this something the component will move with it. It will too hide if the something hide. (Makes it possible for popups and etc.
 - Extensions
 - Userscripts/userstyles
